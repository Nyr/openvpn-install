## openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Debian, Ubuntu, Centos and Amazon Linux with OTP authentication.

This repository has been forked from https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install and added OTP login functionality.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://github.com/Sufleio/openvpn-install/raw/master/openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

### I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that
You can create one from [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) for $3.50/month.
