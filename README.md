##openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It isn't bulletproof but has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

###Installation

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angristan/OpenVPN-install-nyr/master/openvpn-install.sh
chmod +x openvpn-install.sh
./openvpn-install.sh```

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
