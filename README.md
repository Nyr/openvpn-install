OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29)

OS Compatability: Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CentOS and Fedora.

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible. This Script will also work on KVM and OpenVZ containers.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

or as an alternative:

1, apt install wget (if already installed please skip this step)

2, wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyr/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh

3, chmod 700 openvpn-install.sh

4, ./openvpn-install.sh

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
