##openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It isn't bulletproof but has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

###Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

###I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that
You can get a little VPS for just $2/month at [Host1Plus](https://affiliates.host1plus.com/ref/nyr.html).

If you don't care about sharing an IP address with more people, check out the awesome [LowEndSpirit](http://lowendspirit.com/) project too. They are providing IPv6 VPS with NATed IPv4 for only 3â‚¬/year.
